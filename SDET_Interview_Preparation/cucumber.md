# Cucumber and BDD Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. What is the difference between JBehave and Cucumber?
JBehave is a framework specifically designed for Java, while Cucumber supports multiple languages. Cucumber uses Gherkin for writing scenarios, whereas JBehave uses its own syntax.

### 2. What is the language used for expressing scenarios in a feature file?
Gherkin.

### 3. What are Before, After, BeforeStep, and AfterStep hooks?
Hooks are blocks of code that run at specific points in the test lifecycle:
- **Before**: Runs before each scenario.
- **After**: Runs after each scenario.
- **BeforeStep**: Runs before each step.
- **AfterStep**: Runs after each step.

### 4. What are Cucumber tags? Why do we use the tags?
Tags are used to group and filter scenarios for execution. For example, `@Smoke` or `@Regression`.

### 5. What is Cucumber dry run?
A dry run checks the mapping between feature files and step definitions without executing the steps.

### 6. Explain what is Scenario Outline in a feature file?
Scenario Outline allows parameterization of test cases using `<placeholder>` and `Examples` table.

### 7. What is Step Definition in Cucumber?
Step definitions are methods in code that map to steps in the feature file.

### 8. Explain what is BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)?
BDD is a development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders using plain language.

### 9. Define feature file? Mention the components of a feature file?
A feature file contains scenarios written in Gherkin. Components:
- Feature
- Scenario/Scenario Outline
- Steps (Given, When, Then)
- Tags
- Examples (for Scenario Outline)

### 10. What is the meaning of steps in Cucumber tool?
Steps represent actions or conditions in a scenario, written using Gherkin keywords.

### 11. What is the difference between Given, When, Then steps in a feature file?
- **Given**: Precondition.
- **When**: Action.
- **Then**: Expected outcome.

### 12. What is the use of glue property under Cucumber options tag?
It specifies the package containing step definitions.

### 13. What is the difference between Cucumber, JBehave, and SpecFlow?
- **Cucumber**: Multi-language support.
- **JBehave**: Java-specific.
- **SpecFlow**: .NET-specific.

### 14. What are the two main purposes of using Gherkin?
- To write human-readable scenarios.
- To automate tests.

### 15. How to comment a line in a feature file?
Use `#` at the beginning of the line.

### 16. Explain Cucumber hooks?
Hooks are used to execute code before or after scenarios or steps.

### 17. Name any 3 popular BDD testing tools?
- Cucumber
- SpecFlow
- JBehave

### 18. Cucumber tags are case sensitive. True or False?
True.

### 19. Name any two testing frameworks that can be integrated with Cucumber?
- JUnit
- TestNG

### 20. Name any two build management tools that can be integrated with Cucumber?
- Maven
- Gradle

### 21. Name any advanced framework design that can be used with Cucumber?
Page Object Model (POM).

### 22. Selenium can be integrated with Cucumber. True or False?
True.

### 23. Can you name any other BDD tools except Cucumber?
- SpecFlow
- JBehave

### 24. Can we write Cucumber tags (e.g., `@Smoke`, `@Run`) above the Feature keyword in a feature file?
Yes.

### 25. What is the real-time use of Cucumber?
To automate acceptance tests and ensure collaboration between stakeholders.

### 26. What are the Gherkin keywords?
- Feature
- Scenario
- Given
- When
- Then
- And
- But
- Background
- Scenario Outline
- Examples

### 27. If Before hook is available and Background is available for a scenario, in which order will they be executed?
1. Before hook  
2. Background  
3. Scenario steps  

### 28. Types of reports generated by Cucumber JUnit?
- HTML
- JSON
- XML

### 29. How to run multiple feature files in Cucumber?
Use a test runner class and specify the feature file paths.

### 30. How to create a feature file in Cucumber?
Create a `.feature` file and write scenarios using Gherkin syntax.

### 31. How to run Cucumber tests in parallel?
Use plugins like `cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin` or configure parallel execution in the test runner.

### 32. Is Cucumber open source?
Yes.

### 33. What is the starting point of execution for feature files?
The test runner class.

### 34. Should any code be written within the TestRunner class?
No, it only contains configuration.

### 35. Can we use the same step definition in different scenarios?
Yes.

### 36. What is the maximum number of steps that are to be written within a scenario?
There is no strict limit, but it is recommended to keep scenarios concise.

### 37. What software do you need to run Cucumber tests?
- Java
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- Maven/Gradle
- Cucumber dependencies

### 38. Cucumber execution starts from where?
The test runner class.

### 39. On what places can you write tags in a feature file?
- Above the Feature keyword.
- Above the Scenario/Scenario Outline.

### 40. What are the prerequisites for building a Selenium Cucumber automation framework?
- Java
- Selenium
- Cucumber dependencies
- Maven/Gradle

### 41. What are data tables in Cucumber?
Data tables are used to pass multiple sets of data to a step.

### 42. What are the Cucumber assertions?
Assertions validate expected vs actual results using libraries like JUnit or TestNG.

### 43. What is a Cucumber report? Mention the benefits of a Cucumber report?
A report generated after test execution. Benefits:
- Easy to understand.
- Tracks test results.
- Identifies failures.

### 44. Can we use TestNG with Cucumber?
Yes.

### 45. What is the main difference between Scenario and Scenario Outline?
- **Scenario**: Single set of data.
- **Scenario Outline**: Multiple sets of data using Examples.

### 46. Mention the main reasons behind using a simple programming language such as Gherkin?
- Easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand.
- Promotes collaboration.
