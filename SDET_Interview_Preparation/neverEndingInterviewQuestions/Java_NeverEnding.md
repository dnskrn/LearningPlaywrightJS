# Documentation for Core Java & Advanced Java â€“ Theory Based Interview Questions

## General Questions
- **What is Java?**  
    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications.

- **What are the differences between C++ and Java?**  
    Key differences include memory management (Java uses garbage collection), platform independence (Java is platform-independent due to JVM), and syntax differences.

- **List the features of Java programming language.**  
    Features include platform independence, object-oriented, robust, secure, multithreaded, portable, and high performance.

- **What do you understand by Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?**  
    JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It converts bytecode into machine-specific code.

- **What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?**  
    - JDK: Java Development Kit, includes tools for developing Java applications.
    - JRE: Java Runtime Environment, provides libraries and JVM for running Java applications.
    - JVM: Java Virtual Machine, executes Java bytecode.

- **How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?**  
    JVM allocates memory areas such as Method Area, Heap, Stack, Program Counter Register, and Native Method Stack.

- **What is JIT Compiler?**  
    Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler is a part of JVM that improves performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime.

- **What is the platform?**  
    A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. Java provides a software-based platform.

- **What are the main differences between the Java platform and other platforms?**  
    Java is platform-independent due to its bytecode and JVM, whereas other platforms may depend on specific hardware or operating systems.

- **What gives Java its 'Write Once and Run Anywhere' nature?**  
    Java's bytecode and JVM allow Java programs to run on any platform without modification.

## Classloaders and Keywords
- **What is ClassLoader?**  
    ClassLoader is a part of JVM responsible for loading class files into memory.

- **Is delete, next, main, exit, or null a keyword in Java?**  
    No, these are not keywords in Java.

- **If I don't provide any arguments on the command line, then what will the value stored in the String array passed into the `main()` method be: empty or null?**  
    It will be an empty array.

- **What if I write `static public void` instead of `public static void`?**  
    The program will compile and run successfully as the order of modifiers does not matter.

- **What is the default value of the local variables?**  
    Local variables do not have a default value and must be initialized before use.

## Access Specifiers and Static Members
- **What are the various access specifiers in Java?**  
    Access specifiers include `public`, `protected`, `default` (no modifier), and `private`.

- **What is the purpose of static methods and variables?**  
    Static methods and variables belong to the class rather than any instance and can be accessed without creating an object.

- **What are the advantages of packages in Java?**  
    Packages help organize classes, avoid name conflicts, and provide access protection.

## Object-Oriented Concepts
- **What is the object-oriented paradigm?**  
    It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and methods.

- **What is an object?**  
    An object is an instance of a class that contains state (fields) and behavior (methods).

- **What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and an object-based programming language?**  
    Object-oriented languages support all OOP features, including inheritance and polymorphism, while object-based languages may not.

- **What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable?**  
    The default value is `null`.

## Constructors
- **What is the constructor?**  
    A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.

- **How many types of constructors are used in Java?**  
    Two types: default constructor and parameterized constructor.

- **What is the purpose of a default constructor?**  
    It initializes objects with default values.

- **What do you understand by copy constructor in Java?**  
    Java does not have a built-in copy constructor, but it can be implemented manually.

- **What are the differences between the constructors and methods?**  
    Constructors initialize objects, do not have a return type, and are invoked implicitly. Methods perform actions and must be explicitly called.

## Static Members
- **What is the static variable?**  
    A static variable belongs to the class and is shared among all instances.

- **What is the static method?**  
    A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object.

    Static methods cannot access non-static members directly and cannot use `this` or `super`.

- **Why is the main method static?**  
    The main method is static so that it can be invoked without creating an object.

- **Can we override the static methods?**  
    No, static methods cannot be overridden.

- **What is the static block?**  
    A static block is used to initialize static data members and is executed when the class is loaded.

- **Can we execute a program without the `main()` method?**  
    No, starting from Java 7, the `main()` method is mandatory to execute a program.

- **What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method?**  
    The program will compile but will throw a runtime error.

- **What is the difference between static (class) method and instance method?**  
    Static methods belong to the class, while instance methods belong to an object.

## Keywords
- **What is `this` keyword in Java?**  
    The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class.

- **What are the main uses of `this` keyword?**  
    It is used to refer to instance variables, invoke current class methods, and pass the current instance as an argument.

- **Can we assign the reference to `this` variable?**  
    No, `this` is a final reference and cannot be assigned.

- **Can `this` keyword be used to refer static members?**  
    No, `this` cannot be used to refer to static members.

- **How can constructor chaining be done using `this` keyword?**  
    Constructor chaining can be achieved by calling another constructor of the same class using `this()`.

- **What are the advantages of passing `this` into a method instead of the current class object itself?**  
    It allows the method to operate on the current instance without creating a new object.

## Inheritance
- **What is inheritance?**  
    Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class.

- **Why is inheritance used in Java?**  
    It promotes code reuse and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.

- **Which class is the superclass for all the classes?**  
    The `Object` class is the superclass for all classes in Java.

- **Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java?**  
    To avoid ambiguity caused by the diamond problem.

## Aggregation and Composition
- **What is aggregation?**  
    Aggregation is a relationship where one class contains a reference to another class.

- **What is composition?**  
    Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the contained object cannot exist without the container.

- **What is the difference between aggregation and composition?**  
    Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship, while composition represents a "part-of" relationship.

## Miscellaneous
- **Why does Java not support pointers?**  
    To ensure security and simplicity by preventing direct memory access.

- **What is `super` in Java?**  
    The `super` keyword refers to the immediate parent class object.

- **How can constructor chaining be done by using the `super` keyword?**  
    Constructor chaining can be achieved by calling the parent class constructor using `super()`.

- **What are the main uses of the `super` keyword?**  
    It is used to access parent class methods, variables, and constructors.

- **What are the differences between `this` and `super` keyword?**  
    `this` refers to the current class instance, while `super` refers to the parent class instance.
