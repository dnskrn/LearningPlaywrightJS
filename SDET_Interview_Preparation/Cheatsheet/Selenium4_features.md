# Selenium 4 Features â€“ Detailed Explanation

Selenium 4 is a major update with several improvements, new features, and architectural changes that make browser automation more robust and modern. Below are the most significant features and enhancements.

---

## 1. W3C WebDriver Standardization

Selenium 4 follows the W3C WebDriver protocol, eliminating the need for JSON Wire Protocol for communication between client and server.

### Benefits:
- Better stability and compatibility across browsers.
- Less chance of issues due to protocol translation.

---

## 2. Relative Locators

Selenium 4 introduces relative locators (also called Friendly Locators) to find elements based on their position relative to other elements.

### Methods:
- `above()`
- `below()`
- `toLeftOf()`
- `toRightOf()`
- `near()`

### Example:
```java
WebElement email = driver.findElement(By.id("email"));
WebElement password = driver.findElement(with(By.tagName("input")).below(email));
```

---

## 3. Enhanced Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid 4 is fully redesigned using Docker and Kubernetes friendly architecture.

### Improvements:
- Supports Docker containers for scaling.
- Comes with a new GUI Dashboard.
- Supports distributed and standalone modes.
- Built-in support for observability using OpenTelemetry.

---

## 4. Improved Documentation

Selenium 4 comes with revamped, well-organized, and detailed documentation making it easier for users to learn and implement.

---

## 5. Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) Integration

Selenium 4 allows direct access to Chrome DevTools Protocol to perform advanced browser actions.

### Capabilities:
- Network interception and monitoring
- Emulating geolocation
- Capturing performance metrics
- Handling security certificates

### Example:
```java
DevTools devTools = ((ChromeDriver) driver).getDevTools();
devTools.createSession();
devTools.send(Network.enable(Optional.empty(), Optional.empty(), Optional.empty()));
```

---

## 6. New Window and Tab Handling

Selenium 4 provides APIs to open new tabs or windows and switch between them easily.

### Example:
```java
driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.TAB); // or WindowType.WINDOW
```

---

## 7. Full Page Screenshot Support

Selenium 4 supports capturing full-page screenshots in Firefox and Chrome (when supported).

### Example:
```java
File screenshot = ((FirefoxDriver) driver).getFullPageScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
```

---

## 8. Better IDE (Selenium IDE)

Selenium IDE has been rebuilt and now supports:
- Cross-browser playback
- Control flow commands (if, else, while, etc.)
- Plugins and CLI runner using Node.js

---

## 9. Deprecated Methods Removal

Selenium 4 removes several deprecated methods and encourages the use of newer alternatives. This improves API consistency and clarity.

---

## 10. Native Support for Chromium-Based Edge

Selenium 4 provides native support for Microsoft Edge (Chromium), no longer requiring separate workarounds.
