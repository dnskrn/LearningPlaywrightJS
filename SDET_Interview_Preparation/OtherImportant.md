# Scenario-based Automation Testing Interview Questions and Answers

By now, you would have got a basic idea of some important technical questions and answers. It is now time for you to look at some Automation Testing Interview Questions and answers on real-life scenarios. These Automation Testing Interview Questions will help you answer practical questions, even if you haven’t had the opportunity for any practical experience. Let’s find out more:

### 1) How would you automate login functionality for a website?  
**Answer:** The approach to automating login functionality for a website involves finding the elements of the login page using locators. A script is then written to input a username and password and click on the login button. Subsequently, the script verifies if the login was successful by checking if the user is redirected to the correct page or by looking for a specific element on the page.

### 2) If a Test fails, what will be your next step?  
**Answer:** In the event of a Test failure, the appropriate course of action is to first analyse the failed Test case. This involves reviewing the logs, screenshots, or video of the Test execution if available. Then, the script is debugged to check if the failure is due to changes in the application or an issue in the script itself.

### 3) If the application has minor changes, what would be your approach to modifying the Automation scripts?  
**Answer:** The approach to modifying the Automation scripts would depend on the changes in the application. If the changes are related to the UI, then the respective element locators in the scripts should be updated. If there are changes in the functionality, the logic of the script should be modified accordingly.

### 4) How would you handle dynamic elements on a webpage?  
**Answer:** Dynamic elements on a webpage can be handled by using dynamic XPath or CSS selectors that can identify elements based on their relationships with surrounding elements or attributes.

### 5) How would you automate a Test scenario where you need to check if an email is sent after a user registration?  
**Answer:** This can be done with two simple steps. Firstly, the user registration process is automated. Then, an API is used to connect to the email server and verify if an email is received in the inbox.

### 6) If there is a scenario that takes a long time to execute, would you prefer Manual Testing or Automation Testing? Why?  
**Answer:** In such scenarios, Automation Testing is preferred. Automation allows for the execution of the Test scenario multiple times without human intervention, ensuring accuracy and time efficiency.

### 7) How would you automate a scenario where you need to validate the contents of a downloaded file after clicking a button on a webpage?  
**Answer:** In order to automate a scenario for validating the contents of a downloaded file after clicking a button, the first step involves automating the click event on the button. Subsequently, a programming language's file-handling capabilities are used to open and validate the contents of the downloaded file.

### 8) How would you automate a scenario where you need to verify a specific colour, font, and position of an element on a webpage?  
**Answer:** This scenario can be automated by using the WebDriver’s JavaScript executor. JavaScript is executed to get the colour, font, and position of an element, and it is then validated in the Test script.

### 9) How would you handle pop-up windows or alert boxes in your Automation script?  
**Answer:** Pop-up windows or alert boxes can be handled using the Alert interface provided by Selenium WebDriver. The interface offers methods like `accept()`, `dismiss()`, `getText()`, and `sendKeys()`, which can be used based on the requirement.

### 10) How would you automate a scenario where you need to verify if a user is able to scroll down a webpage until the footer section is visible?  
**Answer:** In order to automate this scenario, the WebDriver's JavaScript executor is used to scroll down the page. The `visibilityOf()` method from the ExpectedConditions class is employed to check if the footer section is visible.

### 11) You've been asked to automate a legacy application. What is your approach?  
**Answer:** Automating a legacy application begins with an assessment of existing manual Test cases. The Tests best suited for Automation are identified, and a suitable Automation tool is then selected. Then, the Automation framework is designed and developed to ensure maintainability and scalability for future needs.

### 12) A script you wrote was working fine yesterday but is failing today. How do you troubleshoot?  
**Answer:** In the case of a script that was functioning correctly but is now failing, the first step is to check for changes in the application that might affect the script. The script is then debugged to address issues related to element locators or timing. Additionally, it is important to verify the correctness of the Test data and the environment.

### 13) Your Automation scripts are running slowly. How can you improve the speed?  
**Answer:** In order to enhance the speed of Automation scripts, strategies such as reducing the use of implicit waits, utilising headless browsers for non-UI Tests, parallelising Tests, and optimising code for performance can be employed.

### 14) You are automating a complex workflow with multiple steps. How do you ensure that the test is maintainable?  
**Answer:** Ensuring the maintainability of a complex workflow involves breaking down the workflow into smaller, reusable functions. The Page Object Model is used to separate the Test logic from the page elements.

### 15) Your Automation script is failing due to a change in the application. How do you handle this?  
**Answer:** If a script fails due to an expected change in the application, the script is updated to accommodate the new behaviour. In the case of unexpected changes, the issue is communicated to the development team, and the script is updated once the issue is resolved.

### 16) The Automation script needs to run on multiple browsers and platforms. How do you handle this?  
**Answer:** Automation scripts can be configured to run on multiple browsers and platforms using tools like Selenium Grid. This can also be done with cloud-based services such as Sauce Labs or BrowserStack. It is essential to ensure that the scripts are written in a way that makes them independent of the specific browser or platform.

### 17) You are asked to automate a functionality that is not yet fully developed. How do you handle this?  
**Answer:** Automating a functionality that is not yet fully developed involves collaboration with the development team to understand the expected behaviour. The Automation script is designed based on this understanding, and stubs or mock objects may be used to simulate the undeveloped functionality.

### 18) You are working with a team that follows the Agile methodology. How do you fit Automation into this process?  
**Answer:** In an Agile environment, the focus of Automation is on Test cases that are part of the regression suite and Test cases related to the current sprint's user stories. These Test cases may be included in the Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for immediate feedback.

### 19) How do you handle a situation where the Automation tool does not support a particular control or object in the application?  
**Answer:** If the Automation tool does not support a specific control or object in the application, the first step is to explore potential workarounds. If no viable workaround is available, the issue is communicated to the development and business teams, along with suggestions for possible alternatives.

### 20) You are asked to estimate the time required for automating a Test case. How do you approach this?  
**Answer:** Estimating the time required for automating a Test case involves considering the complexity of the Test case, the maturity of the Automation framework, and familiarity with the application and Automation tool. The estimation also accounts for time allocated to debugging, maintenance, and reporting.
